# consulting-portal

Homepage for a product consulting business. The website should have a professional and modern look, featuring a clean design with a focus on showcasing the business's services, client testimonials, and a contact form. The color scheme should be blue and white, symbolizing trust and clarity. The layout should be user-friendly, with easy navigation to different sections of the site including 'About Us', 'Services', 'Testimonials', and 'Contact Us'. Include a section for a blog to share insights and case studies. The font style should be simple yet elegant, such as Helvetica or Arial.
